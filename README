Introduction

This is a fork from: https://github.com/brianwiddas/gpiodcc

Basic DCC command station for Raspberry Pi. It generates
output suitable for feeding into a Booster (if it accepts 3.3 Volts)
or using a MAX232 driver (if it accepts 5 Volts only).

My setup is as follows:

----------------------------
|Signalbox SRCP Android App|
----------------------------
             | (Wifi)
---------------------------
|Raspberry Pi with gpiodcc|
---------------------------
             |
---------------------------
| MAX232 voltage converter|
---------------------------
             |
---------------------------          ----------------
| MÃ¤rklin Delta Control   |----------| Power Supply |
---------------------------          ----------------
             |
=========================== Track

This does work and is propably the cheapest DCC setup you can have!

The gpiodcc service currently supports the following SRCP command subset:
SET/GET POWER
SET/GET/INIT/TERM GL (loco, only short addresses, 5 functions and 14 or 28 speed steps tested)
SET/GET/INIT/TERM GA (accessory)

Service mode will be supported later.

Pi GPIO Output: Using wiringPi port 8 (please check the net to which pin this corresponds
on your version of the Raspbery). Configurable in dcc.c.

Build:

./make

Run:

sudo ./gpiodcc &
